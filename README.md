# ZeroFlipDotNet

This is my project for the Code Louisville C# course. It is a puzzle game where the player is presented with a board of tiles, with values 0 through 3. Tiles start out flipped face down, and on each turn, the player flips over a tile. If a 0 is flipped over, the game is lost. If all of the 2 and 3 tiles are flipped over, the game is won. Each row and column on the board is labeled with the total value of the tiles in that row/colum, as well as a count of how many 0's are in that row/column.

### Instructions

To run the application:

1. Open the ZeroFlipDotNet solution in Visual Studio.
2. Run the application (Ctrl+F5).

You can also navigate to the ZeroFlipDotNet project folder in Command Prompt or PowerShell, and enter "dotnet run".

### Code Louisville Feature List

- [x] Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- [ ] Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
- [x] Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
- [ ] Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
- [x] Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
- [ ] Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
- [ ] Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
- [x] Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
- [ ] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
- [ ] Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
- [ ] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
- [ ] Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
- [x] Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
